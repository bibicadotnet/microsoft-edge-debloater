## Only Debloater

If you only want to apply the tweaks without installing or disabling updates, you can:
1.  **Download** the `microsoft-edge-debloater` tool [from here](https://github.com/bibicadotnet/microsoft-edge-debloater/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2.  **Extract** the downloaded archive.
3.  **Run** the `vi.edge.reg` file to apply the registry settings.
4.  **Restart Microsoft Edge** by entering `edge://restart` in the address bar.

## Customize Further

If you want to enable/disable more features based on your personal preferences:

-   Open the `vi.edge.reg` file (from the `microsoft-edge-debloater` package) in a text editor.
-   **Comment out** lines you donâ€™t want to apply by adding a semicolon `;` at the beginning of the line, or delete them.
-   To apply changes:
    - Run `vi.edge.reg` again to apply the new configuration.
